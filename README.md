# React weather widget for my Notion dashboard

Icons from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

Data from [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)

## Planned Future Changes

- dynamic locations (currently list of hardcoded locations)  
  -> possibly openweathermap geocoding api
- save locations in localstorage
- more complex weather app and this widget only under widget route
